=== Impact of Token Creation Rate

At first glance, 100% annual increase in the STEEM supply may appear to be hyper-inflationary and unsustainable.
Those who follow the Quantity Theory of Money^http://www.investopedia.com/articles/05/010705.asp[16]^ may even conclude that the value of STEEM must fall by approximately 5.6% per month.
We know from countless real-world examples that the quantity of money does not have a direct and immediate impact on its value, though it certainly plays a role.
Because 90% of all STEEM created is distributed back to holders of SP, the result is similar to having a 2:1 “split” every year rather true inflation.
The total rate of expenditures used to reward contributors is about 10% of the market capitalization per year, a rate well below what Bitcoin sustained for the first 7 years after it launched.
Creating new STEEM to pay an incentive to a particular user or group has a negative effect on every other user’s balance in terms of their ​percentage of the STEEM supply.
If exactly 90% of the STEEM supply is held in SP, then the negative effect of Contribution Incentives on SP holders’ balances is exactly balanced by the positive effect of Power Incentives; SP holders get more STEEM (in nominal terms) but their percentage of the chain (in terms of fraction of the total supply) is unchanged.
If less (more) than 90% of the STEEM supply is held as SP, the two effects still point in opposite directions, but the positive (negative) effect
becomes greater and the sum of these two effects will tend to pull the SP balance toward 90%.
This “pull” does not mean that the SP value must hold at 90% over the long term, because incentive recipients will (and in some cases must) put their STEEM in SP, which means the “pull” towards 90% is not the only force on the percentage of STEEM supply held as SP.

From August 2008 through January 2009 the U.S. money supply^https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?s%5B1%5D%5Bid%5D=AMBNS[17]^ grew from $871B to $1,737B, a rate of over 100% per year and then continued to grow at about 20% per year for the next 6 years.
All told the money supply in the U.S. has grown by 4.59x over less than 7 years.
During that same time, the value of the dollar relative to goods and services has fallen less than 10% according to the government's price index^http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&year1=2008&year2=2016[18]^.
This real-world example demonstrates that supply is only one component of price.

The price of a digital commodity, like STEEM, is driven by both supply and demand.
If new STEEM is allocated to those who are holding long-term then the increase in supply is offset by the corresponding demand to hold.
The impact of this change in supply is postponed until a future date when the long-term holder decides to sell.
The sell pressure is then distributed over 2 years.
When a long-term holder decides to exit, the supply of STEEM  on the market will increase and push the price down.
This downward pressure is countered when a new long-term holder decides to buy up the STEEM and convert it back into SP.
We can therefore conclude that the price will mostly be impacted by a change in demand for holding STEEM long-term.
Of the 100% annual increase in the virtual STEEM supply, 5% of it is in the form of Steem Dollars (SMD).
SMD represents a commitment to create a dollar’s worth of STEEM in the
future and does not impact the amount of STEEM on the market today.
The change in debt-to-ownership ratio may impact the perceived value of STEEM, but it does not map directly into a fall in the value of STEEM.
If the value of Steem rises over time, then the amount of STEEM that may be created in the future will be less and the corresponding “inflation” never actually happened.
All told the total “spending” Steem does to fund content, curation, mining, and liquidity rewards amounts to just 10% APR or 1.2% per month.
The same wealth transfer could be implemented without any change in the STEEM supply by implementing a negative interest rate on liquid STEEM of around 10% per month.
Stated another way, it could be implemented by charging a 3% fee (similar to credit cards) on every transfer and having 1% of all STEEM transferred every single day.
The Bitcoin network transfers 19 400,000 BTC out of 15.5M (or 2.5% daily).

The purpose of liquid STEEM is to facilitate changes in ownership between long-term holders.
It is this change in ownership that the network “taxes” to fund growth.
This transfer tax can be avoided almost completely by automatically selling STEEM for SMD every week as the network converts SP back to STEEM.
The total time spent holding STEEM will be so small that any impact of changing STEEM supply will be insignificant next to volatility and other market fees.

==== Impact of Token Creation Rate Greater than Ninety-Percent

As of May 1, 2016, over 98.49% of all STEEM has been converted to SP.
This demonstrates that demand to hold long term dominates.
In this environment both liquid STEEM and SP are diluted to fund rewards.
For the first 2 years of Bitcoin’s life the network sustained an annual inflation rate^https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=130619.0[20]^ of over 100%.
For the first 5 years it was over 30%, and for the first 8 years it was over 10%.
According to the tool for estimating future inflation included with the Steem source code, Steem by contrast will achieve an instantaneous annual rate of approximately 12% after just 1 year (not including the effects of SMD operations).

==== Accounting In Steem

The increase in the supply of STEEM is mostly an accounting artifact created by the desire to avoid charging negative interest rates on liquid STEEM.
Negative interest rates would complicate the lives of exchanges which would have to adjust user balances to account for the negative rate of return of STEEM held on deposit.
Mirroring the blockchain logic exactly would be error prone and complicate integration and adoption.
Therefore, STEEM has chosen to never charge someone’s account, but instead to increase supply.
This achieves a similar economic result without forcing everyone accepting STEEM deposits to implement negative interest rates on their internal ledger.
A side effect of increasing the supply is that the network will require ever increasing levels of precision in its accounting.
On average the number of bits required to represent a typical account will grow by 1.3 per year.
It will only take 10 years before numbers involved no longer fit within the 53 bit precision supported by JavaScript or the 64 bit precision
supported by CPUs.
Over time the magnitude of the numbers involved grows beyond human scale and comprehension; furthermore, the least significant bits have so little
economic value as to render them meaningless.

In order to compensate for the ever increasing precision, the STEEM network performs a 10:1 “reverse split” every 32,000,000 blocks (about 3 years).
At this point in time all balances of STEEM are divided by 10 and all prices are multiplied by 10.
Cryptocurrency exchanges will have to suspend trading around this time and update the account balances and price history to reflect the “reverse split” before resuming trading.
All rounding errors will be in favor of the network.
Every balance may lose up to 0.009
STEEM due to rounding, but this amount of STEEM should be economically insignificant.
Collectively all holders of SP will lose at most 0.009 STEEM.
