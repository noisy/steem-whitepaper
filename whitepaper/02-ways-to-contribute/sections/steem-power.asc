=== Steem Power (SP)

Start up companies require long-term capital commitment.
Those who invest their money in a startup expect to wait years before they can sell their shares and realize their profits.
Without long-term commitment, a startup seeking to raise additional capital through the sale of additional shares would be competing with existing shareholders looking to exit.
Savvy investors want their capital contributions to grow the company, but growth cannot happen if the new capital is given away to those looking to exit.

There is significant value to having long-term commitment because it enables communities to make long-term plans.
Long term commitment of stakeholders also causes them to vote for long-term growth rather than short-term pumps.

In the cryptocurrency space, speculators jump from cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency based mostly on which one is expected to have short-term growth.
Steem wants to build a community that is mostly owned and entirely controlled by those with a long-term perspective.

Because Steem wants to encourage long-term growth, it is hardwired to allocate 9 STEEM to Steem Power (SP) stakeholders for every 1 STEEM it creates to fund growth through contribution incentives.
Over time this drives the ratio of the total STEEM value of Steem Power balances to the total of STEEM balances toward 9:1.
(It seems likely that the ratio will be somewhat greater than 9:1 due to continued net Powering Up of the newly printed STEEM.)
It also means that long-term holders are almost completely protected from the dilution used to fund growth.

SP can only be converted back to STEEM over 2 years via 104 equal weekly payments.
‘1 SP’ can be viewed as a share in a pool of STEEM.
The network automatically adds STEEM to the pool every block.
At any time users can convert their STEEM into SP at the same ratio as STEEM in the vesting pool to total SP.
Converting STEEM to SP does not dilute existing holders of SP.
Likewise, every time SP is converted back to STEEM it is done at the current ratio.
Individuals are guaranteed to have more STEEM in the future than they have when they first convert from STEEM to SP.

SP balances are non-transferrable and non-divisible except via the automatically recurring conversion requests.
This means that SP cannot be easily traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.

SP is a requirement for voting for or against content.
This means that SP is an access token that grants its holders exclusive powers within the Steem platform.

Transferring from STEEM to SP is referred to as powering up while transferring from SP to Steem is referred to as “powering down”.
For example, one can power down their STEEM over a period of two years, yet one can power up their STEEM instantly.
