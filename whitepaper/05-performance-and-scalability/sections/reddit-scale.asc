=== Reddit Scale

Steem is capable of handling a larger userbase than Reddit. In 2015 Redditâ€™s 8.7 million users generated an average of 23 comments per second^http://expandedramblings.com/index.php/reddit-stats/2/[13]^, with an average of 83 comments per year per user.
There were 73 million top-level posts, for an average of 2 new posts per second.
There were about 7 billion up votes creating an average voting rate of 220 votes per second.
All told, if Reddit were operating on a blockchain it would require an average of 250 transactions per second.
To achieve this industry-leading performance, Steem has borrowed lessons learned from the LMAX Exchange^http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html[14]^, which is able to process 6 million transactions per second.
Among these lessons are the following key points:

1. Keep everything in memory.
2. Keep the core business logic in a single thread.
3. Keep cryptographic operations (hashes and signatures) out of the core business logic.
4. Divide validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks.
5. Use an object oriented data model.

By following these simple rules, Steem is able to process 10,000 transactions per second without any significant effort devoted to optimization.
Keeping everything in memory is increasingly viable given the recent introduction of Optane^TM^ technology from Intel^https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kits/introducing-intel-optane-technology-bringing-3d-xpoint-memory-to-storage-and-memory-products/[15]^ .
It should be possible for commodity hardware to handle all of the business logic associated with Steem in a single thread with all posts kept in memory for rapid indexing.
Even Google keeps their index of the entire internet in RAM.
The use of blockchain technology makes it trivial to replicate the database to many machines to prevent loss of data.
As Optane^TM^ technology takes over, RAM will become even faster while gaining persistence.
In other words, Steem is designed for the architectures of the future and is designed to scale.
