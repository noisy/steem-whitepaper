== Performance and Scalability

The Steem network is built upon Graphene, the same technology that powers BitShares.
Graphene has been publicly demonstrated sustaining over 1000 transactions per second on a distributed test network.
Graphene can easily scale to 10,000 or more transactions per second with relatively straightforward improvements to server capacity and communication protocols.
