=== Mining in Steem

Traditional proof of work blockchains combine block production with the solving of a proof of work.
Because the process of solving a proof of work takes an unpredictable amount of time, the result is unpredictable block production times.
Steem aims to have consistent and reliable block production every 3 seconds with almost no potential for forks.

To achieve this Steem separates block production from solving of proof of work.
When a miner solves a proof of work for Steem, they broadcast a transaction containing the work.
The next scheduled witness includes the transaction into the blockchain.
When the transaction is included the miner is added to the queue of miners scheduled to produce blocks.
Each round one miner is popped from the queue and included in the active set of witnesses.
The miner gets paid when they produce a block at the time they are scheduled.

The difficulty of the proof of work doubles every time the queue length grows by 4.
Because one miner is popped from the queue every round, and each round takes 21 * 3 = 63 seconds, the difficulty automatically halves if no proof of work is found in no more than 21 * 3 * 4 = 252 seconds.

==== Mining Rewards require Steem Power

After the first month, Steem miners are paid in Steem Power (SP).
SP is liquidated through the two-year process of “powering down.”
This means that miners must wait for a long time, likely many months, before sufficient mining rewards have been powered down to allow them to recover the cost of electricity and computational resources.
The powering down process discourages creation of mining pools because the pool operator would have to spread payouts over years.
The effect of paying mining rewards in SP is to prevent miners from using today’s price to determine the profitability of mining.
Few people will agree on what the future price will be.
This means mining difficulty will be driven by those who place the highest estimate on future value.
Miners without a long-term interest in the platform will be discouraged from competing.
Ultimately this means that the proceeds of mining are less likely to be dumped on the market because they will accrue to long-term believers in the platform.

==== Mining Algorithm

The mining algorithm adopted by Steem requires the miner to have access to the private key of the account that will receive the rewards.
This requirement has several important consequences.
First it encourages optimization of elliptic curve signature verification algorithms needed by Steem.
Second it makes it challenging to set up mining pools because the pool operator would have to share control over the reward with all of the “anonymous” miners.
Third, it makes it difficult to use botnets because the botnet operator would have to distribute their private key to all compromised machines.
The following pseudocode describes how the proof-of-work hash value is calculated:


    Let H     = Head Block ID
    Let H2    = SHA256(H+NONCE)
    Let PRI   = Producer Private Key
    Let PUB   = Producer Public Key
    Let S     = SIGN(PRI, SHA256( H ) )
    Let K     = RECOVER_PUBLIC_KEY( H2, S )
    Let POW   = SHA256( K )


==== Botnet Resistant

Many proof of work coins end up being mined by botnets.
A botnet is a collection of thousands or millions of machines that have been compromised by hackers.
These hackers steal the computational and electrical resources of compromised machines to mine cryptocurrency tokens.
Steem has many properties that prevent these computational thieves from profiting.
Botnet operators are profit seeking enterprises and typically sell their stolen resources to the highest bidder.
This means that those who utilize a botnet pay for the computational power in the same way that someone who uses Amazon EC2 does.
The vesting requirement of Steem means that the capital spent on buying the resources of the botnet will be tied up for a long period of time during which the operator is exposed to price volatility.
Another way that botnet operators are prevented from profiting is the requirement to distribute the private key to all compromised machines.
If even one compromised computer is discovered, the operator could lose their coins.
The last mitigation is the dependency on latency.
Most botnets are comprised of computers with poor internet connections, these slow Internet connections will dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the computational resource.
It should be more profitable and less risky for botnet operators to use their resources for other activities than mining STEEM.

==== Mining Pool Resistant

Miners have a total of 3 seconds to receive a block, solve the proof of work, and get the transaction to the next block producer.
Much of this time will consist of network latency which means that it is critical for miners to be well connected to the network to make the most effective use of their computational resources.

Because of the constantly changing head block and network latency, forwarding a template for mining a specific block to participants of a mining pool adds additional network latency and reduces efficiency of pooled mining significantly.
