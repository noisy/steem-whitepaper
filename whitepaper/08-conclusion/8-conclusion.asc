== Conclusion

Steem is an experiment designed to address challenges in the cryptocurrency and social media industries by combining the best aspects from both.
Steem presents earning opportunities to content creators and internet readers in ways that have not existed within the social media industry.
Within Steem, individuals earn real rewards online that are directly correlated to their contributions.
Those rewards will have dollar value due to the market price discovery and liquidity of Steem, and the people who hold Steem will have more exclusive earning powers than those who do not.
