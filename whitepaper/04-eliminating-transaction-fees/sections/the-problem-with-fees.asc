=== The Problem With Fees

Blockchains are decentralized networks where all transactions are broadcast to all peers.
Every so often a block is produced that includes some or all of the pending transactions.
All blockchains must find a solution to prevent malicious users from consuming all of the available network capacity with worthless transactions.
These worthless transactions can prevent other valuable transactions from being processed and ultimately destroy the network.

The solution adopted by most blockchains thus far is to charge a minimum transaction fee.
A fee worth just a few cents is enough to make attacking the network expensive and unprofitable.
While this approach solves the spam problem, it introduces new problems.
Imagine solving the email spam problem by introducing a small fee on every email; people wouldn’t use email.

==== Micropayments Don’t Work

The fundamental problem with charging transaction fees is that micropayments don’t work, especially for low-value user actions.
When a fee is charged on every transaction, it limits the types of transactions that a decentralized network can process.
Regardless of how rational the argument for the necessity of fees, users still hate the experience of being nickeled and dimed for everything that they do.

Imagine if the websites we use every day charged us a fee every time we modify our accounts by changing the password.
Users expect certain things to be free.
Requiring users to make a decision on whether or not an action is worth a small fee creates anxiety that causes users to leave.

A transaction can’t be worth so much as to require a decision but worth so little that that decision is automatic.
There is a certain amount of anxiety involved in any decision to buy, no matter how small, and it derives not from the interface used or the time required, but from the very act of deciding.

Micropayments, like all payments, require a comparison: “Is this much of X worth that much of Y?”
There is a minimum mental transaction cost created by this fact that cannot be optimized away, because the only transaction a user will be willing to approve with no thought will be one that costs them nothing, which is no transaction at all.

In the world of financial payments, small fees are acceptable because the value of the transaction is extremely high relative to the fee charged, and the buyer has already made a decision to buy.
The world of potential blockchain applications is far greater than just financial payments and includes many necessary transactions for which fees are simply unacceptable to users.

Systems like BitShares, Nxt, Ripple, Counter Party and Stellar all allow users to place limit orders on the blockchain and all of them charge users a small fee to perform this action.
Later if the user wishes to cancel their order, another fee is charged.

Systems like Ethereum take micropayments to a whole new level: charging per calculation.
All of these systems struggle to attract new mainstream users for the same reasons that a decentralized search engine would struggle to attract users from Google if it charged a small fee for every search.
It doesn’t matter how good the service is, people expect certain things to be free.
This is true even if a user ends up paying more overall under a different fee structure.

==== Fees are a Barrier to Entry

Any fee creates a barrier to entry for new users.
Before someone can experiment with Ethereum they must acquire some ETH tokens.
Anyone wanting to build a decentralized application on Ethereum must pass on the cost to their customers.
Buying a crypto currency is not an easy task and rarely makes sense for amounts less than $10.
This means that new users wanting to try out a new decentralized application must first be convinced to part with $10.

==== Changing Fees

Over time a network must adjust fees.
This can happen either due to an increase in the value of the token or due to a surge in capacity.
Users like predictable fees and guaranteed service.
While it is possible to dynamically adjust fees during times of heavy use, the result is a poor user experience.

====  Sybil Attacks

Centralized websites prevent spam through rate limiting and some form of ID verification.
Even something as simple as reCAPTCHA^https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html[9]^ is sufficient to limit the creation of fake accounts.
If someone abuses their account then centralized websites are free to block the account.
In a decentralized system there is no direct way to ban users nor centralized provider able to host a reCAPTCHA and enforce rate limiting of accounts.
In fact, the inability to censor users is one of the main selling points of blockchain technology.

==== Full Reserve vs Fractional Reserve

Let’s view a blockchain like an Internet Service Provider (ISP) co-op which owns all of the cables in the town and has a maximum amount of bandwidth that it can provide at any time.
People living in the town can buy shares in the ISP and in exchange they are entitled to utilize a portion of the available bandwidth.
The ISP has two choices, run a “full reserve” or “fractional reserve” system.
Under a full reserve system each user is only allowed a fraction of the maximum bandwidth proportional to her shares.
Because not everyone uses the Internet at the same time, the town’s network would be significantly underutilized.
Under a fractional reserve system the individual users could utilize more bandwidth than they are entitled to at any given point in time so long as not everyone uses the Internet at the
same time.
The problem with operating a fractional reserve is that congestion occurs anytime too many people wish to use the network at the same time.
The ISP needs a way to prioritize bandwidth during congested periods.
In the most extreme case, a fully congested network must revert to a full reserve system.
The challenge is setting the proper fractional reserve ratio.
