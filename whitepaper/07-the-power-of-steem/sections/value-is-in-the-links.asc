=== Value is in the Links

The Internet would lose the vast majority of its value if all links among content were removed.
It is the relationship among web pages that allows Google to identify the best apple pie recipe among the 16 million results.
Without the links the only information Google would have is word frequency.

Links can take many forms and have adapted over time.
Every time a user votes on content in a social network they add a link between themselves and the content.
This in turn links the consumer to the producer through the content.
The more links a network has the more valuable the information becomes.
It is the relative and intentional connectedness of information that gives it value.

A social network can maximize the value extracted from a set of content by maximizing the quantity and quality of links.
Curating content is expensive and time consuming while being near impossible for computers to perform in the absence of links.
Steem rewards users who are among the first to find and link to new content.

By incentivising curation the Steem network is able to use automated algorithms to extract the most valuable information from a massive amount of content.
