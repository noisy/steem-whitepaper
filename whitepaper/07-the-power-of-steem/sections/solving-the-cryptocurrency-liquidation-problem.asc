=== Solving the Cryptocurrency Liquidation Problem

A currency that is difficult to use or impossible to sell has little value.
Someone who comes across $1.00 worth of Bitcoin will discover that it costs more than $1.00 to sell that Bitcoin.
They have to create an account with an exchange, perform KYC validation, and pay fees.
Small amounts of cryptocurrency are like small change that people are unwilling to bend over to pick up.

Merchants give users a way to quickly convert their cryptocurrency into tangible goods and services.
Merchants need a currency pegged to their unit of account, normally dollars.
Accepting a volatile currency introduces significant accounting overhead.

Merchants will accept any currency if it increases their sales.
Having a large user base with a stable currency such as SMD lowers the barrier to entry for merchants.
The presence of merchants improves the system by creating an off-ramp for users to exit the system without going to the trouble of using an exchange.

Another way that people can liquidate the small amounts of cryptocurrency they receive from participating on the Steem platform is through â€‹tipping others.
This is like leaving the small change as a tip for your waiter.
When enough people leave small tips it adds up to a meaningful amount.
You and the waiter each gain a benefit from the tip.
