=== Solving the Cryptocurrency Onboarding Problem

It isn’t easy to get into cryptocurrency^http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-adoption-hard/[24]^.
Someone who discovers Bitcoin and wants to try it out quickly learns that they will need to sign up with an exchange and fund their account with a credit card or wire transfer.
What would Facebook’s adoption rate have been like if you had to fork over money and a two forms of ID?

Steem solves this problem by giving everyone a way to get paid for doing simple, but valuable, tasks.
This will help to widely distribute STEEM tokens.
This is helpful because cryptocurrencies have a network effect (i.e. more users make it more useful; for an extreme example, consider that if Satoshi had kept 100% of Bitcoin for himself, Bitcoin would be worthless.)
