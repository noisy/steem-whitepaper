=== Censorship

Steem is a decentralized network that is operated by miners in jurisdictions around the world.
All user actions are publicly recorded on the blockchain, and can be publicly verified.
This means that there is no single entity that can censor content that is valued by STEEM holders.

Individual websites such as steemit.com may censor content on their particular site, but content published on the blockchain is inherently broadcast traffic and mirrors all around the world may continue to make it available.

Freedom of speech is the foundation of all other liberties and any infringement upon freedom of speech undermines the only peaceful means of reaching consensus: discussion.
Without free discussion voters cannot be fully informed, and uninformed voters are a greater threat to society than losing the right to vote.
Censorship is a means of stealing votes through limiting public discourse.
Steem is committed to enabling free speech and building a free society.
