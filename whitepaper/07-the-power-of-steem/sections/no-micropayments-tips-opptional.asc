=== No Micropayments, Tips Optional

Existing attempts at integrating a cryptocurrency into a social media platform have focused on enabling users to pay one another.
Many services have attempted to introduce tipping.
The theory is that if we make tipping simple enough then more people will do it.
Other services attempt to get people to pay to promote or boost their content’s ranking.
Still others attempt to build small prediction markets on how many tips an article will receive.

All of these approaches boil down to micropayments.
They differ only in who is making the payment.
They all suffer from insufficient engagement of people making the micropayments.
In the search for incentivised content production entrepreneurs have been so focused on who should pay that they missed the obvious reality: everyone benefits from everyone’s actions so everyone should pay or no one should pay, depending on how you look at it.

Steem bypasses micropayments completely because when a user upvotes a post it is the community that pays the bill.
The same amount of money will be spent whether the user upvotes a post or not and the funds will not come from the voter.
The mental energy associated with making an economic decision becomes a barrier to participation for most people.

We already face a multitude of choices everyday with regards to what to access online in this digital era of the information explosion, and every additional decision that we must make simply adds on to the uncertainty and anxiety we face.
Micropayment supporters believe that a simplified implementation can minimize the intrusiveness of micropayments and improve user experience, but their argument only creates double standards for the decision making process[2].
A transaction cannot simultaneously be worth enough to warrant a decision and worth so little that the decision is automatic.
**The only transactions that users can approve without thought are ones that cost them nothing​, thus any micro-transaction of positive value will incur mental costs through its requiring a decision.**
Furthermore, mental transaction costs actually rise below a certain threshold value, a phenomenon that places micropayments at an even greater disadvantage.
For instance, it is easy to think that a copy of today's newspapers costs $1, but readers face much more difficulty and anxiety in deciding on the value of each article or word.
Such a dilemma will only be replicated and exacerbated if all online content were to be broken down into their components and individually valued within a micropayment system.

Under Steem, micropayments are paid to content producer, but those who vote for the content do not pay.
Instead, the cost of the reward is paid for via new tokens.
Someone can join the system, vote to pay someone, and then exit the system with more money than they started with (assuming the market valuation of the Steem system remained constant).
In other words, the micropayment solution provided by Steem provides a user-experience similar to many widely used websites that have user-moderated content.

Furthemore, Steem pays people to figure out who should be paid!
This kind of thinking is revolutionary.
