== The Power of Steem

Steem recognizes that the value of all user contributions (posts and votes) is greater than the sum of the parts.
A single comment is worth next to nothing, but millions of curated posts is worth many millions (or possibly even billions) of dollars.
A single vote provides little curation value, but billions of votes is very effective curation.
Content without curation is of limited value.
Given all the content of the Internet minus the links between it, Google would struggle to produce useful search results.
It is the links between information that give it significant value.
Because everyone benefits, everyone should pay.
In other words, no individual user should be expected to pay for anything, but instead should be paid for everything they do that brings value to Steem.
All we need to do is ascertain which user contributions bring a social network value and which ones don’t.
Collectively Reddit users vote 220 times per second and make 23 posts per second.
Reddit is valued between $500 million^http://www.newsweek.com/investors-think-reddit-worth-500-million-269108[21]^ and $4 billion^http://www.worthofweb.com/website-value/reddit.com/[22]^ which means that each and every upvote and post is worth between $0.06 and $0.50 assuming the value of Reddit is mostly within the past year’s worth of activity.
One could argue that most of the value of Reddit is the near-real-time discussions that have occurred within the past week which would dramatically increase the value of new activity.
People go where people are today, not where people were last year.
